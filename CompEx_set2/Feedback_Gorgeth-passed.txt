Code:
	Well commented, but it would be nice with some line end/continuation for the algorithms.
	A specialized solver for each is a bit overkill when it is only the boundary conditions that varies.
Report:
	Complete, with calculations and result.
	Several misspellings and it would be nice with a clearer difference between the sections(a,b,c,d)
	Teach me oh table master!
Overall:
	Expected convergence rate is wrong, but overall a complete and correct execution.
