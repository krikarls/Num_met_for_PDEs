Feeback av Wilhelm Karlsen (Gorgeth@git) gruppe 6

Files: 
	Good seperation of solver and secondary exercise functions.
	Could have used the filename from the description for the run file.

Readability:
	Could use some more commentary inside the solver function files.
	
Functionality:
	In Problem 1:
		Missing the function 'qudratic', but you have the required functionality.
		Nice use of convergence testing.
	Exercise 21:
		When it runs I only get the angular displacement figure.
		-> The other ones work, each new figure simply overwrites the earlier
		-> figure() before each new one.
Verdict:
	Everything works and the result looks correct.
	Passed!
